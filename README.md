# CNN-based Cascaded Multi-task Learning of High-level Prior and Density Estimation for Crowd Counting  (Single Image Crowd Counting)

This is implementation of the paper [CNN-based Cascaded Multi-task Learning of High-level Prior and Density Estimation for Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09605.pdf) for single image crowd counting which is accepted at [AVSS 2017](http://www.avss2017.org/)

# Installation
1. Install pytorch
   
2. Clone this repository
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/joshbeasley/crowd-counter.git
  ```
  We'll call the directory that you cloned crowd-counter `ROOT`


# Test Experimental Data
1. Run the following command
  ```Shell
  python3 count_crowd.py --data path/to/data
  ```
2. The argument --data takes the path to the iamges that you wish to run the crowd counter on from within the /data directory
